# Avoid
A small 2-D "endless runner" style video game built with Processing.

## Gameplay
The player controls a white square using their cursor to avoid being hit by oncoming coloured squares that rain down from the top of the screen, in which the goal of the game is to survive for as long as possible. Points are gained by successfully dodging squares, and there are a total of 10 difficulty levels which introduce increasingly faster/more frequent squares to dodge.

## Controls
On-screen instructions are provided for starting and restarting the game. The player's white square follows the position of the user's cursor; simply move the mouse left/right to move the white square.

## Running the Game
1. [Download Processing 3.5.4](https://processing.org/releases#:~:text=Version%203.5.4%20%2D,17%2C%202020)
2. Inside the `CS20_FinalProject_Avoid` folder, locate the file `CS20_FinalProject_Avoid.pyde` and open the file with Processing 3.5.4
3. With the source code open in the editor (ensure the mode is set to `Python` in the top right corner), press the play button to run the game
4. When the game window appears, be sure to click inside the game window so the keyboard/cursor focus is within the game
